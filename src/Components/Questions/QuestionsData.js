    ask: "How does your UX design process work?",
    answer:
      "Our UX journey starts with understanding your project and its goals. Here's a brief overview: \n Discovery & Research: We dive deep to understand your brand, end-users, and project objectives, using techniques like interviews, surveys, and market analysis.

    ask: "How much does a design project at your agency cost?",
    answer:
      "Every design project is unique, and so is its pricing! Instead of one-size-fits-all packages, we custom-craft pricing plans based on each project's distinct needs, ranging from UI/UX, Branding, Product Design to Web design. \n Your project's cost hinges on several factors, like its scope, duration, specific requirements, and the expertise involved. Unlike other agencies that focus on hourly rates, we factor in the project's holistic demands, including the dedicated team's expertise. Prices usually fall between $5,000 and $100,000, though it's always best to reach out for an exact quote. \n Got questions or ready to dive in? Drop us an email or give us a call! We also offer a detailed project proposal after understanding your needs. Whether you're a budding startup or a seasoned enterprise, our flexible pricing adjusts to match your goals. ðŸš€",
